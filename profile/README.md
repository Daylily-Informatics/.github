## 🌟 Key Projects  

### 🌼 **Daylily** Ephemeral Cluster && Omics Analysis Workflows  
**[daylily-ephemeral-cluster](https://github.com/Daylily-Informatics/daylily-ephemeral-cluster)**: Infrastructure as code allows on-demand creation of arbitrarily large self-scaling clusters.    
  **Features**:
  - Built using [AWS Parallel Cluster](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/parallelcluster/latest/ug/what-is-aws-parallelcluster.html) *and* [Parallel Cluster UI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/parallelcluster/latest/ug/pcui-using-v3.html).
  - Scans AWS Regions and AZs to determine best spot market pricing, and creates clusters where spot pricing is most competitive.
  - Highly performant globally shared filesystem via [FSx Lustre](https://aws.amazon.com/fsx/lustre/) mirroring reference and other data from *`S3`*.
  - Reproducible and predictable runtimes and costs.
  - Automateable.
  - Fine resolution budget tracking of jobs and resources.
  - Real time cost reporting and decision gating capabilities.
  - Will run *any* slurm based workflow manager ( snakemake, CROMWELL, nextflow, ...).
  - Tight coupling of reference data allows highly performant and nimble ephemeral cluster lifecycles.
  - Designed to be ephemeral-- packaged tools facilitate rapid creation. monitoring, updating, archiving and deleting of ephemeral clusters.

**[daylily-omics-analysis](https://github.com/Daylily-Informatics/daylily-omics-analysis)**: Achieving ~$2–$5 per 30x no-amp WGS from FASTQ to VCF.    
  **Features**:
  - Optimized to run w/in a [daylily-ephemeral-cluster framework](https://github.com/Daylily-Informatics/daylily-ephemeral-cluster).
  - Industry-leading accuracy, speed, cost, auditability, scalability, QC views & observability.  
  - Reproducible, sustainable, growing & open-source omics analysis workflows.  
  - Automated infrastructure management with predictive and real-time cost visibility for storage, data transfer, and compute.  
  - Open source & free: Deploy **daylily** in ~1hr and begin returning completed WGS analysis shortly thereafter.

### 🛠 **Snakemake Executor Plugin**  
**[snakemake-executor-plugin-pcluster-slurm](https://github.com/Daylily-Informatics/snakemake-executor-plugin-pcluster-slurm)**  
  A plugin designed to integrate Snakemake workflows with AWS ParallelCluster’s Slurm workload manager.

### 🧪 **Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS)**  
**[bloom](https://github.com/Daylily-Informatics/bloom)**:  
  A templated, abstract, polymorphic, and opinionated LIMS for efficient laboratory data management. Real time COGS moitoring and operational decision gating.

### 🖨 **Zebra Label Printing**  
**[zebra_day](https://github.com/Daylily-Informatics/zebra_day)**:  
  A library and API for network-connected Zebra printers, managing ZPL label templates and numerous printers with ease.
